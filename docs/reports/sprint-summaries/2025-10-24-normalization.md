## Sprint Objectives ✅

### Primary Goal
Implement signal normalization engine for combining Web3 on-chain signals with L2 order book data for enhanced trading decisions.

### Completed Deliverables

1. ✅ **Signal Normalization Engine** (`app/data/signal_normalizer.py`)
   - Z-score and percentile normalization methods
   - 30-day rolling historical lookback
   - Per-signal independent histories
   - Graceful error handling (NaN, infinity, edge cases)
   - Optional persistence layer

2. ✅ **Web3 Signals Integration** (`app/data/web3_signals.py`)
   - V2 upgrade with normalization support
   - Backward compatible (V1 legacy mode)
   - Free public APIs (Etherscan, The Graph, dYdX)
   - Combined signal scoring with confidence

3. ✅ **Comprehensive Testing** (30 new tests)
   - 100% test pass rate
   - Edge case coverage
   - Real-world scenario tests
   - Persistence testing

4. ✅ **Documentation Updates**
   - V2 normalization guide in `docs/guides/web3-signals.md`
   - Comparison of z-score vs percentile methods
   - Integration patterns with L2 signals
   - Production deployment recommendations

5. ✅ **Interactive Demos**
   - Signal normalization demo (4 scenarios)
   - Full-scale trading simulation (real APIs)
   - Full-scale simulated demo (no APIs needed)

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Improvements

**Before (V1)**:
```python
# Simple threshold-based scoring
if gas_price > 100:
    score -= 1  # Hard-coded threshold
```

**After (V2)**:
```python
# Adaptive normalization with historical context
normalized_gas = normalizer.normalize(gas_price, "gas_price")
score += normalized_gas  # Learns from data, no hard thresholds
```

### Key Innovations

1. **Signal Normalization Formula** (Z-Score):
   ```python
   z = (value - mean) / std
   normalized = 2 / (1 + e^(-z)) - 1  # Sigmoid: [-1.0, +1.0]
   ```

2. **Conviction Scoring**:
   ```python
   conviction = (
       web3_confidence * 0.4 +  # Data availability
       web3_strength * 0.3 +    # Signal magnitude
       l2_strength * 0.3        # L2 imbalance
   )
   ```

3. **Position Sizing** (Kelly-inspired):
   ```python
   High conviction (>0.7):  10% capital
   Med conviction (>0.3):   5% capital
   Low conviction (<0.3):   Skip trade
   ```

numpy==2.3.4      # For signal normalization calculations
scipy==1.16.2     # For percentile ranking (optional)
```

Both already in `requirements.txt` or installed via venv.

## Breaking Changes

### API Changes (Backward Compatible)

**Old (V1 - Still Supported)**:
```python
source = Web3DataSource(normalize=False)
signal = source.get_combined_signal()
signal.score  # int: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3
```

**New (V2 - Default)**:
```python
source = Web3DataSource(normalize=True)  # Default
signal = source.get_combined_signal()
signal.score  # float: -3.0 to +3.0
signal.normalized_gas  # float: -1.0 to +1.0
```

**Migration Path**: All existing code continues to work. New features opt-in via `normalize=True`.

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
1. ⚠️ Web3 APIs occasionally down (gracefully handled)
2. ⚠️ Normalization requires 20-50 samples for stability
3. ⚠️ First call always returns 0.0 (no history yet)

### Limitations
1. 📝 Only 3/6 signals implemented (gas, liquidity, funding)
2. 📝 Dynamic weighting not yet implemented
3. 📝 No backtest integration (manual testing only)

### Mitigation
- Graceful degradation: system works with partial data
- Clear documentation on warm-up period (24-48 hours)
- Simulated demo available for testing without APIs

---

## Sprint Retrospective

### What Went Well ✅
1. Clean separation of V1/V2 (backward compatible)
2. Comprehensive test coverage (100% pass rate)
3. Interactive demos help visualization
4. Documentation thorough and clear
5. Performance exceeds targets (<1ms)

### What Could Be Better 🔄
1. API endpoints changed during development (updated docs)
2. Initial conviction thresholds too conservative (0 trades in quick demo)
3. More integration tests with real L2 data needed

### Lessons Learned 📚
1. Always test with simulated data first (faster iteration)
2. Normalization quality improves dramatically after 20+ samples
3. Graceful degradation is critical for production reliability
4. Clear V1/V2 separation prevents breaking changes
