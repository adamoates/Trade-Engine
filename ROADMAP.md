**Remember**: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Each phase builds on the previous. Don't skip phases or rush through gates. The majority of retail trading bots fail because they skip validation (Phase 5-6) and go straight to live trading with capital they can't afford to lose.

**Your advantage**: Following this systematic, phase-gated approach.
